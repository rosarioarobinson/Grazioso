# Grazioso

Project created in Java for my IT 145 Intro to Software Development class at Southern New Hampshire University. 

Focuses on my understanding of arrays and arraylists, inheritance, classes, and input/output and how to apply that for a prospective client or business. This application helps to track current animals that are being trained, as well as inputting new animals into their care.
